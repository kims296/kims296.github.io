<h3>What really caught me through the video was when Sina Bahram started talking about The 7 Principles of Universal Design. Each principle would explain how things can be incorporated into design where anyone can be able to use it. Where no one will feel excluded, therefore trying to come up with multiple ways of interactions. One of my favorite things that Sina talked about was when the second principle came out, the flexibility in use. He says, “Instead of taking out the color, include color but also include something else that can help the screenreader. Don’t try to subtract, but instead add.” This part I thought was something that is thought to be something so simple. People would think to take out the color thinking that people who might not be able to see color would be at a disadvantage. However, they wouldn't think to include the color, but also add something else because they'd think that it was something of a wrong thing to do by adding the color in. I think that the 7 principles would be very helpful to keep in mind when designing. This video really did give an insight on what to really look for when trying to help the users interact in a more simple and easier way.</h3>
