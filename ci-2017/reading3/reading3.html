<h1>Reading 3</h1>

<h3>This reading mainly talks about how through online there are many biased and unjustified comments and movements that are just overlooked because there’s way too many reported incidents to all go through. Before reading this article, I never really thought about how all these things were seriously going on. It’s upsetting to read that even though all these movements about race, gender, and equality are all going on, nothing is actually really happening. People are going through all these protests and posting online against hate crime, but nothing is really being done. People do report it, and other users of social media are aware of what’s happening, but they don’t really do anything to stand up for it. They go, “Oh my God, that’s terrible. How can someone do that, or that’s so racist, that’s so wrong.” Trying to make an actual difference in the world is something that can’t be done just sitting on a chair looking through your computer. Definitely social media can play a huge factor in putting a voice out, but maybe something more has to be done if we want to actually make something happen.</h3>
