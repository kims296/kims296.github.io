<h3>The reading starts off talking about a smart guy named Bill and how he started working for Apple. Bill explains the trial and error that he went through; for example what should go where so the users will have an easier time using it. Bill Atkinson was a huge role player in Apple later on in life. In the second part of the reading, it questions the readers “How do you…?” There were three main highlights: Interaction Design Paradigms, Interaction Design Process, and Process Example. There are four design processes that are suggested by Bill Verplank: motivation, meaning, modes, and mappings. Later on, Bill shows the design process by telling a story.</h3>
