<h3>The reading starts off talking about a smart guy named Bill and how he started working for Apple. Bill explains the trial and error that he went through; for example what should go where so the users will have an easier time using it. This part got me thinking on the ways of how people design websites or interfaces in certain ways for the navigation to be more simple and accessible. Before this class actually, I never really thought about where the buttons went on a clothing website or any other website and just used it. However, thinking about it, some websites are done so simply and itâ€™s really clever how those designers know where to put what in order for the viewers to have an easy time finding what. Looking at websites now, I start to notice the smallest details on where the buttons are and if it should be placed there or somewhere else for the viewers to have an easy way of navigating through the website. </h3>
