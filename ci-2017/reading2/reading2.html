<h3>This week’s reading talks about the specifics of what interaction really is. An interaction does not just mean using a computer to interact with something. Meredith Davis states that even a printed book can be some sort of interaction. A frame can be considered a new way of focusing on interaction. It talks about how design plays a role in focusing in on interaction, design interaction. There isn't just one type of interaction out there; the author states, “Interaction is a key aspect of function, and function is a key aspect of design.” This part actually caught my eye when Haque argues, “that the process of clicking on a link to summon a new webpage is not “interaction”; it is “reaction.” I never thought of thinking it as a reaction because one would think that because we would have to click on a hyperlink to move on, we would be interacting with it.</h3>
